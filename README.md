# What The Heck is This? 
Takes a bunch of worm pictures you add, and randomly generates from them.
Expects all images to be the same size, and .png format. "Types" of worm (aka A worms, B worms) should be designed so every part fits with every other part of that type
Also, everything that isn't the base MUST be transparent. The base is optionally transparent uwu
Naming scheme defaults to baseX00.png / eyesX00.png, etc.

I'm learning as I go, but I'm doing my best to make this easy to read, for any future internet goers who need something like this.
